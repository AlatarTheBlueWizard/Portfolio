    <h1>Transforms and Transitions</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>The CSS3 transform property lets you lets you translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew any element on the page.</li>
        <li>The value of the transform property is one or more transform functions (separated by spaces) that will be applied in the order they’re provided.</li>
        <li>Translation functions allow you to move elements left, right, up, or down.</li>
        <li>When you employ a translation function, you’re moving elements without impacting the flow of the document.</li>
        <li>A translated element can only be moved relative to its current position.</li>
        <li>If you only want to move an element vertically or horizontally, you can use the translatex or translatey functions respectively.</li>
        <li>The scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors horizontally then vertically.</li>
        <li>It’s also worth remembering that scaling, like translation, has no impact on the document flow. </li>
        <li>The rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle value.</li>
        <li>The skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes.</li>
        <li>The transition-property property defines the CSS properties of the element that should be transitioned, with all for all properties being the default.</li>
        <li>You can provide any number of CSS properties to the transition-property declaration, separated by commas. </li>
        <li>The transition-duration property sets how long the transition will take: the duration of time it takes to go from the default state to the transitioned state.</li>
        <li>The transition-timing-function lets you control the pace of the transition in even more granular detail. </li>
        <li>The most common timing functions include the key terms ease, linear, ease-in, ease-out, or ease-in-out .</li>
        <li>A negative time delay that’s less than the duration of the entire transition will cause it to start immediately, but it will start partway through the animation.</li>
        <li>The transition properties allow for multiple transitions in one call.</li>
        <li>A keyframe is a snapshot that defines a starting or end point of any smooth transition.</li>
        <li>To animate an element in CSS, you first create a named animation, then attach it to an element in that element’s property declaration block. </li>
        <li>Keyframes can be specified in any order; it’s the percentage values rather than the order of the declarations that determine the sequence of keyframes in the animation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Canvas, SVG, Drag & Drop</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>All drawing on the canvas happens via the Canvas JavaScript API.</li>
        <li>The canvas's context is the place where your drawing is rendered</li>
        <li>WebGL is a new API for 3D graphics being managed by the Khronos Group</li>
        <li>Both strokeStyle and fillStyle are set on a context object, and both take one of three values: a string representing a color, a CanvasGradient object, or a CanvasPattern object.</li>
        <li>When you see an anonymous function defined as an event listener, it means that the anonymous function is being bound to that event.</li>
        <li>toDataURL creates a URL with the image in it, (either a png or jpg, whichever is specified). You can then right-click the image at this URL, and save it as a PNG or JPEG.</li>
        <li>Once we’ve drawn an image on the canvas, we can use the getImageData method from the Canvas API to manipulate the pixels of that image.</li>
        <li>getImageData will return an ImageData object, which contains three properties: width , height , and data . </li>
        <li>Data contains information about the pixels in the ImageData object in the form of an array.</li>
        <li>If you want to test pixel manipulation using canvas in Firefox or Chrome, you’ll need to either test it on a web server running on your computer (http://localhost/), or test it online.</li>
        <li>A major downside of canvas in its current form is its lack of accessibility.</li>
        <li>The canvas doesn’t create a DOM node, is not a text-based format, and is thus essentially invisible to tools such as screen readers.</li>
        <li>Unlike canvas, images created with SVG are available via the DOM.</li>
        <li>Since SVG is an XML file format, it’s also more accessible to search engines than canvas.</li>
        <li>If you need to paint pixels to the screen and have no concerns about the ability to retrieve and modify your shapes, canvas is probably the better choice.</li>
        <li>If you need to be able to access and change specific aspects of your graphics, SVG might be more appropriate.</li>
    </ul>
