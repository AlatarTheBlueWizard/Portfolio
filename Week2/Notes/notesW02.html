    <h1>Programming Basics</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Comments are ignored by the program, but make your program easier to read and understand</li>
        <li>Data types are the basic building blocks of all JavaScript programs</li>
        <li>There are six primitive data types: strings, symbols, numbers, Booleans, undefined and null</li>
        <li>Non-primitive data types, such as arrays, functions and objects, all have a type of 'object'</li>
        <li>Variables point to values stored in memory and are declared using the const or let keywords</li>
        <li>Values are assigned to variables using the = operator</li>
        <li>Strings and numbers have various properties and methods that provide information about them</li>
        <li>Symbols are unique, immutable values</li>
        <li>Boolean values are either true or false</li>
        <li>There are only seven values that are false in JavaScript and these are known as 'falsy' values</li>
        <li>Data types can be converted into other data types</li>
        <li>Type coercion is when JavaScript tries to convert a value into another data type in order to perform an operation</li>
        <li>Logical operators can be used to check if compound statements are true or false</li>
        <li>Values can be compared to see if they are equal, greater than or less than other values</li>
        <li>Variables that start with an underscore generally refer to private properties and methods, so it's best to not follow this convention for your own variable names</li>
        <li>Only objects have properties and methods. JavaScript overcomes this by creating wrapper objects for primitive data types</li>
        <li>Template literals can be thought of as super-powered strings as they behave in the same way as normal string literals, but with the extra power of string interpolation</li>
        <li>JavaScript is known as a weakly typed or loosely typed language. This means that you don't need to explicitly specify what data-type a variable is when you declare it</li>
        <li>NaN is the only value in JavaScript that is not equal to itself</li>
        <li>Should we always use Number.isNaN() to check if a value is NaN? is there a limit or should we do it as often as possible?</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Array, Logic, and Loops</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Arrays are an ordered list of values</li>
        <li>Multidimensional arrays are arrays that contain other arrays</li>
        <li>Arrays have lots of methods that can be used to manipulate items in the array</li>
        <li>Sets are new in ES6 and are ordered lists of non-duplicate values</li>
        <li>Maps are new in ES6 and are ordered lists of key-value pairs</li>
        <li>We can use an if and else statement to control the flow of code</li>
        <li>The switch statement can be used instead of multiple if and else statements</li>
        <li>A while loop and do ... while loop can be used to repeat a block of code while a condition is still true</li>
        <li>A for loop works in a similar way to a while loop, but has a different syntax</li>
        <li>A for-of loop can be used to iterate over an array</li>
        <li>Sets and maps are enumerable, so can also be looped over using a for-of loop</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Functions</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Functions are first-class objects that behave the same way as other values</li>
        <li>Function literals can be defined using the function declaration, or by creating a function expression by assigning an anonymous function to a variable</li>
        <li>All functions return a value. If this is not explicitly stated, the function will return undefined</li>
        <li>A parameter is a value that is written in the parentheses of a function declaration and can be used like a variable inside the functionâ€™s body</li>
        <li>An argument is a value that is provided to a function when it is invoked</li>
        <li>The arguments variable is an array-like object that allows access to each argument provided to the function using index notation</li>
        <li>The rest operator can be used to access multiple arguments as an array</li>
        <li>Default arguments can be supplied to a function by assigning them to the parameters</li>
        <li>Arrow functions are a new shorthand notation that can used for writing anonymous functions in ES6</li>
        <li>Function declarations can be invoked before they are defined because they are hoisted to the top of the scope, but function expressions cannot be invoked until after they are defined</li>
        <li>A callback is a function that is provided as an argument to another function</li>
        <li>All functions have a read-only property called 'name'</li>
        <li>DON'T REPEAT YOURSELF</li>
        <li>How can you check if an argument is a function?</li>
        <li>Is it better to use arrow functions for callbacks?</li>
    </ul>
