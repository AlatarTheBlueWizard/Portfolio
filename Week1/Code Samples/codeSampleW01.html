    <p>The story editor project in the "doing stuff with web things" book (starting p.36) is 
      the example I attached.<br/> I may attach more snippets on this code sample page from other
      research, however below is the link to the project I<br/> created following the exercise in
      the book (Localstorage section).

    <h2>Local Storage Snippets and Explanation</h2>
    <img src="../../images/display_story_snippet.PNG"/>
    <p>The displayArea function first identifies the value of the text inputted by the user in the textarea.
      <br/>That value is then placed within the section (story_editor) and displayed to the user.
    </p><br/>
    <img src="../../images/load_story_snippet.PNG"/>
    <p>The loadStory function first identifies the value of the text inputted by the user in the input field <br/>(in this 
      case the story title). Thanks to the localStorage.setItem property from saveStory applying <br/>a key-value pair,
      the getItem property for localStorage in loadStory is able to find the saved/applicable <br/>title (if it matches)
      and then displays it's story editor value in the story editor textarea using innerHTML.
    </p><br/>
    <img src="../../images/save_story_snippet.PNG"/>
    <p>The saveStory function first identifies the value of the text inputted by the user in the input field.<br/>
      The function then identifies the text value in the story editor textarea. The name and value variables<br/>
      are then saved into a key-value pair using the setItem property of localStorage (which is then utilized in loadStory).
    </p><br/>
    <img src="../../images/section_snippet.PNG"/>
    <p>The section tags are used in order to force the buttons to be on a seperate line from the input field by taking the 
      whole <br/>width of the page, hence making the output more readable. The button onclick attributes call the js functions,
      hence <br/>giving them the ability to perform the desired functionality once clicked.
