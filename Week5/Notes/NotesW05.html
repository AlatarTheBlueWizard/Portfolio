    <h1>Testing and Debugging</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Bugs are unavoidable in code, and it’s best to find them early rather than later</li>
        <li>JavaScript can be put into strict mode using the string "use strict". This can be used in a whole file or just a single function</li>
        <li>Linting tools can be used to ensure your code follows good practice and conventions</li>
        <li>Feature detection can check whether a method is supported before calling it, helping to avoid an exception being thrown</li>
        <li>The console and browser’s built-in debugging tool can be used to interactively find and fix bugs in code</li>
        <li>Exceptions can be thrown using the throw statement</li>
        <li>An error object is created when an exception occurs</li>
        <li>Any code placed inside a try block will pass any error objects to a catch block when an exception occurs. 
            Any code inside a finally block will run if an exception does or does not occur</li>
        <li>Test-driven development is the practice of writing tests that fail, then writing the code that passes 
            the test, then refactoring the code every time a new feature is implemented</li>
        <li>The Jest framework can be used to test your code</li>
        <li>Remember to remove any references to the debugger command before shipping any code, otherwise the program will appear to freeze when people try to use it!</li>
        <li>Test-driven development(TDD) is the process of writing tests before any actual code</li>
        <li>Testing frameworks provide a structure to write meaningful tests and then run them</li>
    </ul>
